The "vsQuery" project each contain "server" and "datao  wner" folders, representing operations specific to the corresponding entities, such as tree construction, updates, queries, and verification. Here, client operations are not distinguished from data owner operations.

A test case is provided in the Main function in the vsQuery folder, which can be directly run to obtain information related to index construction, querying, and validation.
